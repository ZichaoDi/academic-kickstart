My research comprises the development of mathematical models and efficient
optimization methods to tackle challenging applications arising from real-life
phenomena. I have worked on a generalization of multigrid methods for solving
optimization problems ranging from vector quantization, optimal control to
inverse problems. Another particular interest is information integration and
multimodal data analysis especially from tomographic data sources.
